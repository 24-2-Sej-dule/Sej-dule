# Sej-dule (셋둘)

**Language**: [English](README_KOR.md)

### 1. Project Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a webpage called "Sej-dule" to organize and display the classroom schedules at Sejong University. Currently, the Sejong University website lacks a convenient feature for quickly checking the availability of specific classrooms. Users must search on the site or download an Excel file to manually find information about the classroom they want, which is inconvenient.

Sej-dule addresses these issues by offering a service that shows class schedules and empty time slots by classroom in an intuitive way, making it easy for users to see classroom availability at a glance.


### 2. Key Features

- **Classroom Schedule Visualization by Time**
    - Using the **Chart.js** library, Sej-dule visually displays classroom schedules by time slot, allowing users to quickly check a specific classroom’s class and empty periods at a glance.
- **Emphasis on Available Time Slots**
    - To help users easily identify free classrooms, **vacant times are visually highlighted**, enabling quick and clear checks of classroom availability.
- **Search by Classroom and Date**
    - To facilitate quick access to the classroom schedule for a specific date, Sej-dule provides **classroom and date filtering options**, allowing users to efficiently manage their time by quickly viewing the schedule of their preferred classroom.

### 3. Data Collection Method

Classroom schedule data is gathered from the 2024 academic schedule on Sejong University's Academic Information System. This data includes classroom-specific information, detailing the classes held and their time slots.

Through this, classes can be opened at a certain time and when they are available in a specific classroom, and it supports students to easily check the classrooms they can use freely.

### 4. Expected Benefits

- **Improved Access to Classroom Information**: Users can quickly and easily check the availability of their desired classroom, reducing unnecessary search steps and making information retrieval more convenient.
- **Reduced Stress**: Fewer steps are needed to locate available classrooms, reducing the frustration and stress of searching for information.
- **Efficient Time Management**: The ability to easily identify empty classrooms allows students to effectively plan free or self-study periods.
- **Enhanced User Convenience**: Without complicated searches or downloads, users can intuitively check classroom information, making the academic environment more user-friendly.
