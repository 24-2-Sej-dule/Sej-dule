# Project Overview

**Sej-dule**: A web application that allows Sejong University students to easily check classroom schedules and availability at a glance.

This project develops a webpage, **Sej-dule**, to organize and display classroom schedules at Sejong University. Currently, the Sejong University website lacks a convenient feature for quickly checking the availability of specific classrooms. As a result, users must search through the website or download Excel files to manually find the desired classroom, which is inconvenient.

**Sej-dule** aims to solve this problem by visually displaying the occupied and available times for each classroom, making it easy for users to determine classroom availability.
